"""
You might have heard about permutations and combinations in mathematics.
In this example, letâ€™s see how we can find out combinations using Python recursive functions.

Here is the equation for finding the combination:

nCr = n! / r! (n-r)!
Here, n is the total number of items and r is the number of combinations needed.

For example, consider taking combinations of 2 values from A, B, C, D.


4C2 = 4! / 2! (4-2)! = 24/2(2) = 24/4 = 6

The Python code for implementing combinations is given below:
"""


def fact(n):
    if n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return n*(fact(n-1))


def combination(n, r):
    return fact(n)/(fact(r)*fact(n-r))


n = int(input("Enter n: "))
r = int(input("Enter r: "))
print(int(combination(n, r)))
